<h1 align="center">Hello there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

**My name's Roberto, I made the first big step on my coding journey by completing the transformative School of Code Bootcamp in 2023 since then I have continued to learn and develop and
am currently looking for my first professional role.**



Before starting to code, I worked on a wide range of musical
composition projects spanning television and internet commercials,
children's animation, documentary, and short film, with work
shortlisted for awards at numerous international festivals in the
categories of film score and advert composition.

I have always loved creating things, and my introduction into coding
stemmed from trying to make simple ios apps and games through
learning Swift and discovering a genuine passion in the process.

However, when Iâ€™m not tinkering with code and attempting to make
little games,  I enjoy other creative pursuits such as drawing and
reading comics/graphic novels, working on soundtracks and practicing
on my piano and accordion.

Looking forward to making lots of cool projects and uploading them here!
