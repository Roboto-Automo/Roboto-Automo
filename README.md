## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**My name's Roberto, and I am about to begin my coding journey with the School of Code Bootcamp.**

I've already learned some Swift as an introduction into coding and have completed some small Html and CSS projects via Freecodecamp.

I'm currently using Freecodecamp to help me get aquainted with Javascript before starting the course and as of 27th February 2023 I'll be starting #100daysofcode.

Looking forward to making some cool projects and uploading them here!
